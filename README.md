==========================================================

This is a Google Chrome Extension that notifies a user that
the domain they're accessing has been registered via
GoDaddy, who short-sightedly supports legislation
that would destroy the free internet as we know it.

This software does not, in any way, restrict GoDaddy's
ability to conduct business. Users of this software
may use the information gathered to make informed consumer
decisions.

To install, simply load [nodaddy.crx](https://raw.github.com/astronoob/nodaddy/master/nodaddy.crx) 
in Chrome. Alerts will automatically appear during normal browsing.
